                <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American 
                    industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a
                    child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas 
                    Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft 
                    the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals. 
                    Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial 
                    playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was
                    amassed through investment in real estate before the city 
                    became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne 
                    Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides
                    just outside of Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports 
                    philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation,
                    but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In publ
                    ic, he appears frequently in the company of high-status 
                    women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce 
                    Wayne leads an active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts
